  intro: `I am a predoctoral associate of research at Duke University and a PhD candidate specializing in race and ethnic politics at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research centers on understanding how Black individuals navigate racism within the context of their intersecting personal identities, such as gender, socioeconomic background, and cultural affiliations.`,
  text: `My dissertation, titled "Red, White, and Black: Black Racial Grievance and Black American Identity," delves into the intricate relationship between individuals' psychological responses to racism and the subsequent influence on their behaviors, attitudes, and overall Black American identity. Through this exploration, I aim to contribute valuable insights into the complexities of being both Black and American.`,
  text_2: `In collaboration with Janelle Wong, our published work in Advances in Political Psychology addresses the influence of race on political attitudes within the religiously unaffiliated group. Through our research, we illuminate the underlying factors contributing to the rise of nonreligious individuals in the U.S. Furthermore, our study delves into the complex landscape of racial disparities in stances on crucial issues like same-sex marriage, immigration, and taxes, uncovering insights that have far-reaching implications for understanding contemporary political dynamics.`,
