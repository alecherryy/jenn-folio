  intro: `I am a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland, College Park, specializing in race and ethnic politics, political psychology, and political behavior.`,
  education: `My research broadly delves into the ways in which Black individuals navigate their racial identity alongside other facets of their personal identity. In my dissertation, titled "Red, White, and Black: Black Racial Grievance and Black American Identity," I have developed and tested a novel framework. This framework explores how Black individuals' psychological comprehension of racism influences their identity and behavior as Americans.
  In collaboration with Janelle Wong, I have also published work in Advances in Political Psychology. This particular study examines the political attitudes of non-religious people of color within an increasingly secular landscape. Compared to non-White, non-religious voters, White, non-religious voters adopt the most liberal attitudes about non-racial policies, while adopting the most conservative attitudes about racial policies. In 2020, I was awarded a $10,000 grant from the University of Maryland, College Park with my co-advisor, Lilliana Mason. And I was awarded the Baumann Fellowship for the years 2021-2023 where I serve as a research assistant to my co-advisor, Chryl Laird. `,
  education_2: `This fellowship was also accompanied with a $10,000 grant from the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences.
  Before joining Maryland, I earned a B.A. in Communication (with honors) from Florida Atlantic University and an M.A. in Communication from Wake Forest University. I am a proud child of Haitian immigrants and a native of south Florida. Beyond academia, I have a penchant for live music, Publix chicken tender subs, and distinctive craft beers.`,
