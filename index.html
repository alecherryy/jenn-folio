    Baltimore County. My research explores identity, race, psychology, and behavior, focusing on
    how Black people overcome disillusionment and maintain their commitment to democracy.
    Before joining UMBC, I was a predoctoral associate of research at Duke University and served
    as a head teaching assistant for the Ralph Bunche Summer Institute. You can find my work
    published in journals such as Advances in Political Psychology."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"/><title>JÃ© St Sume</title><script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.b0979dcf.js"></script><link href="/static/css/main.99ca742d.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
